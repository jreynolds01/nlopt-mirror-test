# nlopt-mirror-test

Just trying to mirror nlopt 2.4.2 to test a few things with the notebooks.azure.com service.

This repo is just going to contain nloptr-2.4.2.tar.gz because I'm having trouble retreiving it from the mit homepage.

The source page is located: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

With the source .tar.gz file located: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/nlopt/nlopt-2.4.2.tar.gz
